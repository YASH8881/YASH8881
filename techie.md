   <li> Currently, 🌱 I’m currently learning myself in the captivating world of Full Stack Web Development through Udemy, and let me tell you, it's a thrilling experience. Learning the fundamental trio - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - has been like discovering a new language, a language that can bring ideas to life on the web. 🌐💡
